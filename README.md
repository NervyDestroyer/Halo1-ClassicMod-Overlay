# Classic Mod Overlay
This will allow you to overlay the classic map files over top of the "built-in" maps and also allow you to restore by creating a backup prior to overlaying.

This exists because the steam workshop menu in MCC is extremely prone to crashing which doesn't make for a very good speedrun does it...

You can install the Classic Mod for Halo CE here:

You may need to install .NET 8:

## How To
Recommend using the "Steam Search" button and pointing it to your "steamapps" folder that you have both your MCC and Mod downloaded to. The fields will auto-populate and get you up and rolling faster (if you have MCC and Mod installed to your C: drive, this happens automagically at startup).

From there, once you click "Overlay Classic", first all base MCC maps will backed up to a folder called "OverlayMccBackup" inside your MCC halo1 folder. After, the mod map files will overwrite the installed halo1 maps.

Once overlayed, make sure you select "built-in" on the MCC menu. This will load the Classic Mod without the nasty crashing.

Once you're ready to play base MCC, simply click on Restore MCC and boom, your "built-in" will get restored back to the MCC maps.

## Oh No! The Backup got Corrupted???
It's more likely you've just not overlayed the maps yet. A backup is only created after clicking "Overlay Classic".

If your backup actually got corrupted. Right click the game in Steam and click on Properties. From there navigate to Installed Files and click "Verify integrity of game files". That will restore all your maps back to their retail state.
